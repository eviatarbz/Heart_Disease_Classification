# Heart_Disease_Classification
In this project, I used a Kaggle dataset to predict whether a person has heart disease or not, by organizing the data set (standardizing, removing ouliers etc), building SMOTE algorithm and training machine learning models (SVM, LogisticRegression, KNN, RandomForest, AdaBoost) on the dataset, I was able to get the accuracy of 94.5%.
